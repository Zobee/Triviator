Triviator

Web app showcasing the use of the Open Trivia Database API in a single-page application

I'm not using React Router for this project specifically to see if I can. It's fun to change it up, and relying on router would make the transitioning of components much easier. The downside is, the code looks hella clunky.

I need to put more effort into the design. As of now, I'm not sure exactly how I want it to look aesthetically.
